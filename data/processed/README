Capstone Project – Water inequalities across CPLP member states

Project Overview

This project examines long-term trends and inequalities in access to drinking water across Portuguese-speaking countries (CPLP) between 2004 and 2024. The analysis explores differences between rural and urban populations, country-level trajectories over time, and national performance relative to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) regional averages.

Data source

The analysis is based on drinking water access estimates from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP), which provides globally comparable WASH indicators used for monitoring progress toward SDG 6. The raw dataset includes country-level information on service levels (e.g., at least basic, limited, unimproved), population, income groupings, and SDG regions.

Data processing and wrangling

Raw JMP data were cleaned and reshaped using the tidyverse in R. Key processing steps included:

Standardising and cleaning variable names and labels
Converting the dataset to a long, analysis-ready format
Filtering the data to CPLP countries and selected years
Harmonising service-level indicators and residence categories (rural, urban, total)
The processed datasets are saved as CSV files to ensure reproducibility and ease of reuse.
