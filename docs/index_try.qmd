## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(here)

water_data <- read_csv(here::here("data/processed/water_data.csv"))

# Inspect
glimpse(water_data)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
ggplot(water_data, 
       aes(x = year, 
           y = population_thousands, 
           color = country_area_or_territory,
           group = country_area_or_territory)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 0.5) +
  geom_point(size = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "Evolution of Population Over Time",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Population (Thousands)",
    color = "Country"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
