CPLP Drinking Water Access Analysis (2000–2024)

Capstone Project – WASH Data Analytics

Overview

This project analyses the evolution of access to drinking water in Portuguese-speaking countries (CPLP) over the past 25 years, using global WASH estimates from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP). 
The goal is to evaluate national progress toward Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) and understand inequalities across rural and urban populations.

The project includes data cleaning, transformation, exploratory analysis, and visualisation using the tidyverse. 
The processed dataset is reshaped into a long, analysis-ready format for reproducible research.
